> * `UPPER_CASE` denotes user-supplied parameters, and arguments with square brackets<br> e.g. `[/date DATE]` denote
    optional arguments, while arguments not in square brackets are mandatory.
> * Any text e.g. `DESCRIPTION` has to come before arguments.<br>
    `in Salary /amount 500 /goal  Savings` is a valid command, while `in /amount 500 /goal Savings Salary` is not a valid
    command.
